Write up step by step instructions for converting the app to TS





Add the Angular 2 demo to my repo
    Make sure that it runs for me

Presentation
    Set expectations up front that 45 minutes is not enough time to cover all aspects of Angular development with TS
        There will be some hand waving
        But that's so we can spend more time on the fun stuff
    Cover what it takes to get your environment setup
        Show the atom-typescript page
    Plug our next TypeScript meeting

Add presentation and PDF to the repo

Add simple styles to my app
    Be sure to also update the TS version






Ask Ken to review my app
    Cleanup unused code in the controllers

Do the Tour of Heroes A2 tutorial

No styles???
    Keep the focus on the code???
    Add simple styles???

Install Atom snippets
    https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#style-y253

Do source maps continue to work even after converting to TS???

Just use NPM scripts to compile and serve???
    Like the Angular 2 demo???










Agenda
	TS Overview - 20 minutes
		Quick slides
		Show basic language features
			Data types
			Classes
			Interfaces
			ES6/ES7 features
				let/const
				modules
	AngularJS 1 and TS - 15 minutes
        Starting with simple app
        Change all *.js to *.ts
        Add tsconfig.json
        TS doesn't know about "angular"
            Using typings to bring in the type definition file
		Tips and Tricks
            Follow John Papa's style guide
            Use classes for controllers
                Use "controller as" syntax
            Prefer services to factories
	Angular 2 and TS - 5 minutes
		Compare and contrast...
			Controller > Component
			Service > Service
				Services should be able to be shared with very little change
    Next steps
        ngForward can make your AngularJS 1.x code feel more like Angular 2
        Get familiar with ES6 modules and a module loader like SystemJS






Write up list of things to consider when using AngularJS 1 with TS
	Prefer Services to Factories
	Use "Controller As" Syntax
		This allows you to make your controllers TS classes
	Follow John Papa's style guide
		Show how to layout your controllers
	Quick overview of ngUpgrade and ngForward

How to prepare for Angular 2
	Learn TS
	Learn ES6 modules
		SystemJS seems to be the preferred module loader
	Learn RxJS observables
	???



Research

	Reactive Extensions RxJS

	Work up an updated demo for SystemJS and ES6 Modules
		Config help
			https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/blob/master/docs/config-api.md

	How would we use Gulp, JSPM, or Webpack to setup a proper app structure???
		We should separate our source from compiled code

	What are each of these used for???
		"dependencies": {
			"angular2": "2.0.0-beta.3",
			"systemjs": "0.19.6",
