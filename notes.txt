	Quick overview of ngUpgrade and ngForward

How to prepare for Angular 2
	Learn TS

	???



Research

	Reactive Extensions RxJS
		I've been hearing a lot about this
		What does it do???
			Sounds like it provides observables

	Work up an updated demo for SystemJS and ES6 Modules
		Config help
			https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/blob/master/docs/config-api.md

	How would we use Gulp, JSPM, or Webpack to setup a proper app structure???
		We should separate our source from compiled code

	What are each of these used for???
